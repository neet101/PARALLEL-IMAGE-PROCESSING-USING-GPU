# PARALLEL-IMAGE-PROCESSING-USING-GPU

The performance of Deep Learning models has been the region of interest for a number of researchers over the past five years. Accuracy and Speed have invariably been the indicators in this regard. Our aim is to present a brief comparison of the training times and accuracy of GPU and CPU. The same is tested on a couple of architectures (GPU & CPU) across multiple hardware platforms.
